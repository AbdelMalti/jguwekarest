# Swagger Jersey generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
http://localhost:8081/swagger.json
```

You can POST an arff file to WEKA with:

```
curl  -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@/yourpathtowekadata/weka-3-8-1/data/weather.nominal.arff;" -F "estimatorParams=0.5"  -F "searchAlgorithm=local.K2" -F useADTree=0 -F "estimator=SimpleEstimator" -F searchParams='-P 1 -S BAYES' http://0.0.0.0:8080/weka_rs/algorithm/BayesNet
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!
